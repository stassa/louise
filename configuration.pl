/** <module> Configuration options for Louise and associated libraries.

Predicates in this module represent configuration options for Louise,
its auxiliaries, sub-systems and libraries.

Brief description of configurable options
-----------------------------------------

The following is a quick list of configuration options, along with a
quick description of their use.

* :-debug(Subject): enable/disable logging for Subject.
* clause_limit/1: maximum number of clauses learned from one example.
* example_clauses/1: how to treat examples with bodies.
* experiment_file/2: path to the current experiment file.
* fold_recursive/1: fold overspecial programs to introduce recursion.
* generalise_learned_metarules/1: generalise TOIL-learned metarules.
* learner/1: name of the current learning system (louise).
* learning_predicate/1: current learning predicate.
* listing_limit/1: maximum lines printed when listing a MIL problem.
* max_error/2: how many negative examples a hypothesis can "cover".
* max_invented/1: maximum number of invented predicates.
* metarule/2: metarules known to the system.
* metarule_constraints/2: metarule constraints for Louise.
* metarule_learning_limits/1: control over-generation in TOIL.
* metarule_formatting/1: how to pretty-print metarules.
* minimal_program_size/2: lower limit for learn_miminal/[1,2,5]
* recursive_reduction/1: recursively apply Plotkin's reduction.
* reduce_learned_metarules/1: apply Plotkin's reduction to TOIL output.
* reduction/1: how to reduce the Top Program.
* resolutions/1: depth of resolution in Plotkin's reduction.
* symbol_range/2: used to pretty-print metarule variables.
* tautology/1: what Louise considers a tautology.
* theorem_prover/1: resolution or TP operator (doesn't work).
* unfold_invented/1: unfold to remove invented predicates?

Navigating the configuration file
---------------------------------

The quickest way to navigate to a configuration option is as follows.

First, move your cursor at the top of the configuration file, where the
:-module/2 declaration exporting the public predicates of this module
resides. In many systems you can move to the start of a file with
"Ctrl+Home".

Place your cursor on the name of the configuration option you wish to
edit.

In the SWI-Prolog IDE, press Ctrl + . (dot). That will bring up a dialog
titled "Find definition of predicate [in new window]". I don't know why
it says "new window" but the predicate will be listed with arity 0,
always. Correct the arity to the arity of the option you want to
navigate to and press OK.

Alternatively, if you're not in the SWI IDE, you can copy the name of
the option you wish to change and use your favourite editor's search
function to search for it. It's more convenient to search for the name
of the option followed by an opening parenthesis, e.g. "reduction(", so
that you jump straight to the definition of the option, or at least the
start of its structured comment (or precede the search with the
start-of-line character, e.g. "/^reduction(" to avoid the structured
comment).

Editable options
----------------

In general, only configuration options defined as definite clauses
should be changed by the user. Directives (Horn goals of the form
':-Goal') setup the environment required by Louise and its sub-systems
and should be left well enough alone. The only exception to this rule is
the :-debug(Subject) options that enable and disable logging.

Setting configuration options
-----------------------------

When a configuration option in this file is changed, the file must be
reloaded. The simplest way to do this is to call SWI-Prolog's make/0
predicate. Like this:

==
?- make.
% c:/users/.../louise/configuration compiled into configuration 0.03 sec, 0 clauses
true.
==

Note that make/0 only rebuilds the Prolog project. It is _not_ the same
as the unix program "make".

Known errors
------------

Sometimes, editing an experiment file, then editing this configuration
file and then reloading the project with make/0 can cause SWI-Prolog to
throw up a bunch of permission errors. In that case, the safest bet is
to kill the SWI-Prolog session and start a new one. Sorry, not much I
can do about that.

Accessing configuration options
-------------------------------

Modules that require configuration options generally query them by
addressing the configuration option directly through its module
identifier, for example "configuration:clause_limit(K)" etc.

Foreign configuration options
-----------------------------

This configuration file re-exports a number of configuration modules
from the various libraries under louise/lib. Thse can be seen in the
reexport/1 and reexport/2 directives at the start of this file (above
the module structured comment). Those "foreign" configuration options
must be set by editing their corresponding module files (in the lib/
subdirectory where that library resides).

However, some foreign configuration options that are very frequently
used are excepted from re-exporting and are instead re-defined here, to
avoid having to edit multiple configuration files all the time. You can
see those options by eyballing the reexport/2 directives: they're the
ones in the "except" term as resolutions/1 in the example below:

==
:-reexport(lib(program_reduction/reduction_configuration),
	   except([resolutions/1])).
==

Dynamic options
---------------

Some configuration options defined in this file are declard dynamic.
These can in general be set without editing the configuration file, with
a call to set_configuration_option/2, as shown in the example below:

==
:- auxiliaries:set_configuration_option(max_invented, [3]).
==

Unfortunately, set_configuration_option/2 can often leave behind garbage
in the form of duplicate options (i.e. multiple clauses of the same
option predicate, each with different values). Often this manifests as
nondeterminism in normally deterministic learning predicates (such as
learn/1).

In that case, the user may have to inspect the current values of
configuration options loaded in memory with list_config/0 and then
retract/1 duplicate options by hand. This is a, well, sort of temporary,
solution and a better one will be implemented at some point. The dynamic
database is evil.

Multifile options
-----------------

A couple of configuration options defined in this module file,
particularly metarule/2 and metarule_constraints/2 are declared
multifile so that they can be included in experiment files to keep a
permanent record of those important MIL problem elements. These options
can also be set in the configuration, for example the user doesn't have
to copy metarule/2 clauses in their experiment files everytime and can
instead refer to the ones defined in this module file directly. See the
various example experiment files under louise/data/examples for examples
of setting those configuration options in an experiment file.

%!      clause_limit(?Limit) is semidet.
%
%       Limit the number of resolving clauses learned from each example.
%
%       Limit should be a natural number, including 0, or the atom 'inf'
%       representing positive infinity if a limit is not required.
%
%       __What is this clause limit__
%
%       Informally, Limit is the maximum number of clauses resolving
%       with each other that will be learned from each positive example
%       "in one step" of learning.
%
%       Louise learns by an SLD-refutation proof of positive examples
%       with first-order background knowledge and second-order
%       metarules. Accordingly, a more formal definition of Limit is
%       that it is the maximum cardinality of the set of clauses in one
%       refutation sequence of any one positive example.
%
%       A single clause is always assumed as the first clause in a
%       refutation sequence, therefore clause_limit(0) is a valid option
%       that means a single clause is learned that does not resolve with
%       any clauses in a hypothesis (including itself).
%
%       Note that the same clause can appear multiple times in a single
%       refutation sequence. This is the case, e.g., when a clause is
%       "called" recursively. This includes a single, self-resolving
%       clause.
%
%       __What the clause limit is not__
%
%       Limit is _not_ the maximum number of clauses in _hypotheses_.
%       Louise learns a hypothesis for a set of examples by "stitching
%       together" all "sub-hypotheses" learned from each example. It's
%       the size of these sub-hypotheses that is restricted by Limit.
%
%       Limit is also _not_ a limit on the resolution steps, or
%       recursion depth, of an SLD-refutation of an example.
%
%       Louise does not impose any limitation on the size of hypotheses,
%       or the depth of resolution and recursion.
%
%       __Choosing an appropriate clause limit__
%
%       In general, you should set clause_limit/1 to one of the
%       following settings:
%
%       * clause_limit(0): Set this option if you don't need recursion
%       and predicate invention. Louise can still learn some recursive
%       clauses this way.
%
%       * clause_limit(1): Set this option if your target theory is a
%       single, recursive clause resolving with itself any number of
%       times.
%
%       * clause_limit(K): (where K > 1). Set this option if you want
%       Louise to learn arbitrary recursion.
%
%       With a clause limit of "0", Louise can still learn a limited
%       form of recursion where recursive clauses can only be learned if
%       they resolve with a positive example.
%
%       With a clause limit of "0" or "1" Louise cannot do predicate
%       invention. Invented predicates' clauses must resolve with at
%       least one clause of a target predicate in the learned program,
%       so a clause limit of 2 or more is necessary: that's one clause
%       for the target predicate, one for the invented predicate.
%
%       Note that if predicate invention is required, the option
%       max_invented/1 must also be set separately to an appropriate
%       value (representing the number of predicate symbols that Louise
%       will try to define).
%
%       Be advised that _for many problems_, if clause_limit/1 is set to
%       a number higher than 1, you will also need to provide
%       appropriate constraints to avoid Louise trying to prove all
%       possible recursive theories, and likely blowing up your RAM in
%       the process.
%
%       __Usage__
%
%       This configuration option is used by prove/6, Louise's inductive
%       Prolog meta-interpreter.
%
%       __Examples__
%
%       See the example files hello_world.pl, yamamoto.pl, recipes.pl
%       and ackermann.pl in data/examples for examples demonstrating the
%       use of different settings of clause_limit/1 to learn recursion
%       and predicate invention.
%
clause_limit(0).


%!      example_clauses(?What) is semidet.
%
%       What to do with example clauses.
%
%       This option determines how Louise treats examples that are given
%       as definite clauses with one or more body literals (rather than
%       ground atoms), i.e. "example clauses".
%
%       What is one of [bind,call].
%
%       If What is "bind", example clauses are bound to each instance of
%       a metarule where that is possible.
%
%       If What is "call", the head literal of each example clause is
%       bound to the enapsulated head literal of a metarule, then the
%       body literals of the example clause are called. This may
%       result in the universally quantified variables in the head of
%       the clause, and so the encapsulated head literal of the
%       metarule, to be bound.
%
%       Use "bind" when you have a set of definite clauses that you want
%       to transform to instances of a metarule.
%
%       Use "call" when you want to use a set of definite clauses with
%       bodies to generate examples.
%
%example_clauses(bind).
example_clauses(call).


%!	experiment_file(?Path,?Module) is semidet.
%
%	The Path and Module name of an experiment file.
%
experiment_file('data/examples/hello_world.pl',hello_world).
%experiment_file('data/examples/tiny_kinship.pl',tiny_kinship).

%!      fold_recursive(?Bool) is semidet.
%
%       Whether to fold overspecialised programs.
%
%       If Bool is set to 'true' Louise will attempt to fold an
%       over-specialised program to introduce recursion.
%
%       @tbd Currently, only learn/5 and its family recognise this
%       option.
%
fold_recursive(false).


%!      generalise_learned_metarules(?Bool) is semidet.
%
%       Whether to generalise learned metarules.
%
%       "Genearlisation" heare means that second-order variables in
%       learned metarules are "named apart", so for example a learned
%       metarule "P(x,,y):- Q(x,z), P(z,y)" is genealised by replacing
%       each instance of the second-order variables P and Q with new,
%       free variables, resulting in the metarule "P(x,y):- Q(x,z),
%       R(z,y)".
%
%       The new metarule is more general than the original in the sense
%       that its instances may or may not be recursive clauses- while
%       the first metarule forces the head and last body literal to have
%       the same predicate symbol.
%
%       The motivation of this option is to allow learning metarules
%       that better generalise to unseen examples. Set this option to
%       true if learn_metarules/[1,2,5] returns overly-specific
%       metarules that can only represent the training examples well.
%
%generalise_learned_metarules(true).
generalise_learned_metarules(false).


%!	learner(?Name) is semidet.
%
%	Name of the learning system this configuration is for.
%
%	Name is one of [louise,thelma].
%
%	Used to switch context between Louise and Thelma, where this is
%	needed. The typical use case is when experiment code must check
%	the values of configuration options that are particular to one
%	or the other system (e.g. resolutions/1 is not present in
%	Thelma etc).
%
learner(louise).


%!	learning_predicate(+Learning_Predicate) is semidet.
%
%	The Learning_Predicate to be used in list_learning_results/0.
%
%	Learning_Predicate is a predicate indicator, the symbol and
%	arity of one of the following learning predicates defined in
%       Louise:
%       * learn/1
%       * learn_meta/1
%       * learn_metarules/1
%       * learn_minimal/1
%       * learn_with_examples_invention/2
%       * thelma/1
%
%       The specified predicate will be used to list the learning
%       results for all learning targets defined in an experiment file
%       with a call to list_learning_results/0.
%
%	learning_predicate/1 is declared as multifile. To specify the
%	learning predicate to be used with list_learning_results/0, add
%	a clause of learning_predicate/1 to the relevant experiment
%	file.
%
%	For example, the following clause:
%	==
%	configuration:learning_predicate(learn_meta/1).
%	==
%
%	Will cause list_learning_results/0 to use learn_meta/1 for
%	all predicates in the experiment file containing that clause.
%
%	learning_predicate/1 is declared dynamic. You do not have to
%	specify a learning predicate for every experiment file.
%	list_learning_results/0 will default to learn/1.
%
%	Note that learning_predicate/1 will not affect learning by
%	calling learning predicates directly. That is, having added a
%	clause of learning_predicate/1 like the one above to an
%	experiment file you are free to then call learn/1 or any other
%	learning predicate on any of the learning targets in that
%	experiment file. Only the learning predicate used by
%	list_learning_results/0 is affected by this option.
%
%	Finally, note that specifying any other predicate than the three
%	learning predicates listed above as a learning_predicate will
%	cause list_learning_results/0 to raise an error.
%
%	@see list_learning_results/0
%
%       @tbd learning_predicate/1 is also used in lib/evaluation to
%       choose the learning predicate used to evaluate a learning
%       result. Predicates in that library default to learn/1 when
%       learning_predicate/1 is not defined.
%
:-dynamic learning_predicate/1.
:-multifile learning_predicate/1.
%learning_predicate(learn/1).
%learning_predicate(learn_minimal/1).
% etc.


%!      listing_limit(?Limit) is semidet.
%
%       Limit the clauses printed when a MIL problem is listed.
%
%       Limit is a number, limiting the number of clauses of examples
%       and BK that will be printed to the output when a MIL problem is
%       listed. Affects list_mil_problem/1 and
%       list_encapsulated_problem/1.
%
%       Limit should be a positive integer. It can also be the atom
%       'inf' representing positive infinity. If Limit is 'inf', then no
%       limit is imposed on the printed information.
%
listing_limit(10).


%!	max_invented(?Number) is semidet.
%
%	Maximum number of invented predicates.
%
%	Assumes clause_limit(K) where K > 1.
%
max_invented(0).


%!      max_error(?Hypothesis,?Clause) is det.
%
%       Maximum error allowed for a Hypothesis and each Clause in it.
%
%       "Error" in this context means the number of negative examples
%       entailed by a clause, or a Hypothesis, with respect to
%       background knowledge. Errors of that type are more formally
%       known as "inconsistencies" in ILP terminology.
%
%       Hypothesis takes precedence over Clause. What this means is that
%       if Clause > Hypothesis, then the maximum number of negative
%       examples a clause is allowed to entail, with respect to
%       background knowledge, before it is discarded, is equal to
%       Hypothesis, while the maximum number of negative examples
%       entailed by a hypothesis remains equal to Hypothesis.
%
%       This option allows Louise to behave similar to Aleph, and
%       similar systems, with the setting "error" set to something other
%       than 0. Its purpose is to allow more natural results when
%       learning from datasets designed for propositional learners.
%
%       @tbd This option affects specialise/3 but is currently taken
%       into account only with clause_limit(K=1). If K > 1, this option
%       has no effect. This makes sense because clause_limit(1) is
%       sufficient for propositional-style learning problems, whereas
%       clause_limit(K > 1) is for more relational-style problems where
%       errors are much less tolerable and noise is not that common
%       anyway. This may change in a future version if there is a need
%       for it.

%!	metarule_constraints(+Target,+Metarules) is nondet.
%
%	A set of Metarules given as constraints for a learning Target.
%
%	Target is the symbol and arity of a learning target.
%
%       Metarules is a list of constants, the ids of metarules to be
%       used as constraints. Any metarule can be used as a constraint.

%
%       How to print metarules learned with new_metarules/1.
%
%       How is one of: [quantified, user_friendly, expanded].
%
%       Option "quantified" prints metarules with quantifiers and in
%       formal notation found in the MIL literature. Use this option to
%       compare metarules with the ones in the literature, or just to
%       get a more clear explanation of a metarule.
%
%       Option "user_friendly" prints metarules in Louise's user-level,
%       and user-friendly format of metarules in experiment files. Use
%       this option when you want to copy a metarule and later paste it
%       to an experiment file. For example, this option is handy when
%       you learn metarules with TOIL and you want to reuse them in an
%       experiment file.
%
%       Option "expanded" prints metarules in Louise's internal format,
%       encapsulated and expanded, with an encapsulated metasubstitution
%       atom in the head. Use this option to inspect what Louise
%       actually sees when you declare a metarule.
%
%       Note that the metarules printed with option "expanded" cannot be
%       directly copy/pasted into an experiment file. Or, well, sure
%       they can... but they won't be picked up by experiment_data/5 and

%
%	Setting Bool to true enables recursie reduction of the Top

%	reduction step is given as input to the reduction algorithm in
%	the next step (also known as "doing the feedbacksies").
%
%	Recursive reduction can result in a stronger reduction in less
%	time, with a lower setting for resolutions/1 (in fact, the same
%	amount of reduction can take less time exactly because the
%	resolutions/1 setting can be set to a lower value).

%	Recursive reduction is more useful when the Top program is large
%	and many resolution steps are required to remove all redundancy
%	from it.

%!      tautology(+Clause) is det.
%
%       True when Clause is a tautology.
%
%       This configuration option formalises the concept of a
%       tautological clause as it is used in Louise. In short, a clause
%       is a tautology if it is a definite clause with one or more body
%       literals and all its literals are identical.
%
%       For example, the following clause is considered to be a
%       tautology:
%       ==
%       p(A,B):- p(A,B), p(A,B)
%       ==
%
%       Whereas the following clauses are not considered to be
%       tautologies:
%       ==
%       p(a,b)
%       p(A,B):- p(B,A)
%       ==
%
%       And so on. Formalising the concept of tautology in Louise is
%       useful because of the way the Top Proram Construction (TPC)
%       algorithm works. TPC adds to the background knowledge the set of
%       positive examples, which then functions as an extensional,
%       partial definition of each target predicate. TPC then
%       generalises each example to a clause that entails the example
%       with respect to the background knowledge. Since the background
%       knowledge includes each positive example, it is possible and in
%       fact common to end up with clauses generalising an example by
%       creating an implication of an atom of the example's predicate by
%       one or more instances of itself. For example, if p(a,b) is a
%       positive example, p(A,B):- p(A,B) is a clause tautologically
%       expressing the fact that each atom of p/2 entails itself.
%
%       Such tautologies are removed from the Top program by Plotkin's
%       program reduction algorithm since they are always entailed by
%       the rest of the Top program (and by anything else, ever really).
%       However, alternative reduction methods, such as subhypothesis
%       selection or minimal program learning do not rely on entailment
%       of a clause by the rest of the program and so may not be able to
%       get rid of tautologies as simply as Plotkin's reduction. For
%       such reduction methods, a tautology check is needed. This
%       predicate forms the basis of such a check.
%
%       Note that tautological clause generally only arise when the
%       Identity metarule, or one of its specialisations is in the set
%       of metarules for a MIL problem. The Identity metarule is P(x,y)
%       :- Q(x,y) where {P,Q} are second-order existentially quantified
%       variables that are not constrainted to be different. If P = Q
%       then the resulting clause is a tautology, but this is not always
%       the case, so Identity is generally useful (in fact,
%       indispensible, given that it represents one third of the
%       properties necessary to construct an equivalence relation). A
%       specialisation of Identity is a metarule with multiple clauses
%       having identical literals up to renaming of their second order
%       existentially quantified variables, for example the following is
%       a specialisation of Identity: P(x,y):- Q(x,y), R(x,y) and if P =
%       Q = R the resulting clause would be a tautology as defined by
%       this predicate.

%!	theorem_prover(?Algorithm) is semidet.
%
%	Theorem proving Algorithm to use in Top program construction.
%
%	Algorithm is one of: [resolution, tp].
%
%	With option 'resolution', the Top program is constructed in a
%	top-down manner, using SLD resolution.
%
%	With option 'tp', the Top program is constructed in a bottom-up
%	manner, using a TP operator.
%
%	__Trade offs__
%
%       Option 'resolution' is generally faster when clause_limit(1) is
%       set because it hands off to the Prolog interpreter. On the other
%       hand the meta-interpretation can enter infinite right-recursion
%       (left-recursion is avoided by tabling).
%
%	Option tp is slower because it's implemented in Prolog and it's
%       not terribly optimised either. 'tp' currently can't perform
%       predicate invention. On the other hand, 'tp' guarantees
%       termination and runs in polynomial time, at least for definite
%       programs (but then, there are no guarantees outsid of definite
%       programs). Finally, 'tp' only accepts datalog programs, so for
%       example it will not work on problems where examples or BK have
%       lists not hidden away by flattening.
%
%       While the current implementation of the TP Operator does not
%       allow for predicate invention, bottom-up predicate invention is
%       possible, as described in "Complete bottom-up predicate
%       invention in MIL" by Hocquette and Muggleton, published
%       in IJCAI-20. Implementing this in Louise is left for future
