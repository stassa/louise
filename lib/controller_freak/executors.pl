%!      solve_executor(+Solver,+Map,+Display,-SLAM).
%
%       Execute a solver using a SLAMming map to solve a real Map.
%
%       This predicate first carries out a "survey" mission: searching
%       the map exhuastively with a controller, followed by seeking the
%       start and end tiles to complete the mapping of the unseen
%       environment with grid-SLAM. Once a map is created in this way it
%       is used to generate the clauses of an action model for the
%       Solver, then the Solver is executed to solve the real Map, but
%       using the model derived from the SLAMming map. If all succeeds
%       the SLAMming map is returned at the end. Each of the three steps
%       of the process: searching, seeking and solving, can be displayed
%       separately by setting the controller_freak_configuration option
%       debug_environment/3.
%
%       Solver is a list of clauses of a logic program representing a
%       solver.
%
%       Map is a map/3 term.
%
%       Display is one of: [tiles,blessed,none], denoting how the Solver
%       solving the Map is to be displayed. This is required for the
%       environment initialisation.
%
%       SLAM is the SLAMming map derived during execution of the Solver
%       and its attendant controllers.
%
%       @tbd This predicate incorporates multiple tests of execution and
%       is more appripriately considered as being at the "mission" or
%       experiment level, above execution. To be honest it's a bit of a
%       hack to allow a complete SLAMming map to be used with the
%       Solver. The non-hack version would entail a special-uprose
%       controller that can do the whole mapping on its own. But I
%       suppose for the time being it fits into this module.

%
%       Initial is a set of fluents, not observed by the controller,
%       that determine the state of the hidden environment where the
%       controller operates. "State" here refers to the environment
%       state, not the controller state.
%
%       Q0 and O are the starting state and initial observation of the
%       controller in the environment behind the Initial state.
%
%       Goal is a set of fluents, the same as in Initial, but with
%       different values, that defines a goal state that the controller
%       much reach, starting at the given Initial state, Q0 and O. To
%       make things more interesting, Goal should not include the X/Y
%       coordinates of a destination on a map, only the tile at the
%       destination.
%
%       Actions is a list of action labels, the actions taken by the
%       controller to reach the Goal state from the Initial state.
%       Actions are in the order in which they were taken during
%       execution fo the controller.
%
%       Model is a list [X/Y,Map], where X/Y is a pair of coordinates,
%       and Map a map/3 term, of the map created by a controller
%       exploring an environment. X/Y are the coordinates of the
%       controller in Map at the location where it stopped exploring.
%
%       Clauses of executor/6 are selected according to the
%       controller_freak_configuration option executor/1, that
%       determines the execution strategy for controllers. Known

%       * backtracking: magickally teleport back in time.
%       * reversing: painstakingly reverse course.
%       * backtracking_slam: as 'bakctracking' but also builds a Model.
%       * reversing_slam: as 'reversing' but also builds a Model.
%
%       When the value of the executor/1 option is 'backtracking' or
%       'reversing' Model is the empty list. Otherwise, grid_slam/7 is

%       Reversing executor.
%
%       Init and Goal are the lists of fluents representing the initial
%       and goal states, respectively, of the environment in which the
%       controller operates. Fluents are never accessed by an executor
%       an donly passed to the environment, along with controller
%       actions, to receive an observation.
%
%       Tuple is a pair S:T, where S is an _executor_ state (yes, yes I
%       know, too many damn states) and T is a partially instantiated
%       tuple of the form T(Q,O,A,Q1). Executor states are one of:
%       [trv, rev, alt] and determine how the stack is managed. All
%       tuples discussed below are of the same form as Tuple.
%
%       Stack is a stack of ground Tuple's, the stack that drives the
%       executor's, and the executed controller's, behaviour. When Stack
%       is empty, execution terminates.
%
%       Tuples is a list of ground tuples collected at the end of each
%       recursive step.
%
%       Goals is a list of fluents defining a goal state in the current
%       environment. When Fluents unifies with Goals, execution
%       terminates.
%
%       Discussion
%       ----------
%
%       The Stack in this executor is used to implement a sort of
%       backtracking in-place, without magickal jump-backs to unvisited
%       branches, which may not be avialable in an environment. Instead,
%       this executor reverses course when a dead end is found, where no
%       more actions are possible. This setting assumes that only
%       reversible actions are taken, otherwise the controller may get
%       well and truly stuck in an unrecoverable situation.
%
%       What actions are reversible, and how, is determined by the
%       controller, which must declare a predicate reversible_action/2,
%       of the form reversible_action(A1-Q1,A2-Q2), where A1-Q1 is an
%       action and next-state label, and A2-Q2 are the same, but
%       reversed. For example, a grid-navigating controller may
%       broadcast the following opposite actions:
%       ==
%       opposite_actions(up-q0,down-q2).
%       opposite_actions(down-q2,up-q0).
%       opposite_actions(left-q3,right-q1).
%       opposite_actions(right-q1,left-q3).
%       ==
%
%       Whether an action should be reversed, or not, and how, is
%       determined by the executor's own state.
%
%       The executor state is reflected in a Tuple's form and determines
%       how the stack is updaed. A tuple can be a traversing tuple, of
%       the form trv:T, an alternative tuple, of the form alt:T, or a
%       reversing tuple, of the form rev:T. Accordingly, the executor
%       can be in state "trv", traversing, "alt", for alternatives, or
%       "rev" for "reversing".
%
%       A quick intution about the way the stack is updated depending on
%       executor states is as follows:
%       * At each step of execution all controller tuples matching the
%         current controller state and observation are pushed to the
%         stack, then the first tuple is popped from the stack and its
%         action sent to the environment to obtain a new observation.
%       * In state "trv", the reverse of each action taken is pushed on
%         the stack as a member of a new "rev" tuple.
%       * In state "rev", no tuple is pushed on the stack.
%       * In state "alt" each tuple popped from the stack puts the
%         executor in state "trv".
%
%       This way the controller traverses a map until it reaches a dead
%       end, and begins reversing its course. When the controller
%       reaches the last place where it had an alterantive, it stops
%       reversing and starts traversing and pushing alternatives to the
%       stack again.
%
%       More technically, the reversing executor's loop is as follows:
%       a) Push all possible tuples to the stack.
%       b) Pop a tuple, T, from the stack
%       c) Ground T by interaction with the environment.
%       d) If T is not a reversing tuple, push its reverse on the stack.
%       e) Repeat until Stack is empty or Fluents unifies with Goals.

%
%       Push all possible tuples to the Stack.
%
%       T0 and T1 are tuples, of the form S:T, where S is a controller
%       state, and T is a tuple T(Q0,O,A,Q1). The tuples in T0 and T1
%       are chained so that their variables are bound as in
%       T0(Q0,O,A1,Q1), T1(Q1,O1,A2,Q2).
%
%       Stack is the current executor stack, a list of tuples.
%
%       Updated is Stack updated with all instances of T1 returned by
%       the current controller, according to the binding to T1, and
%       ensuring that an action label A2 in T1 will not be the same as
%       the action label A in T0, to avoid oscillations.
%
%       Note that T0 can also be the atom 'nil' a hack to avoid passing
%       in an empty stack at the start of execution because I like my
%       terminating conditions to be above my recursive clauses. In that
%       case Stack should also be the singleton list [nil] and T can
%       only be of the form trv:T.
%
%       When T0 is of the form rev:T, Stack and Updated are the same.
%       That is to say, when the executor is in reversing state it does
%       not reverse its actions, because that would be reversing the
%       reverse; possibly of the reverse, of the reverse, etc, causing
%       (long-term) looping forever.
