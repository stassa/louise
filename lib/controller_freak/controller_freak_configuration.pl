%       Whether to debug a Subject, and how.
%
%       Determines whether map_logging/2 prints a map for "logging" or

%
%       Subject is a debug subject received from map_logging/2.
%

%
%       Determines whether environments being solved will be logged to

%
%       How is one of: [tiles, coordinates, both, false]. "false" can be
%       substituted for any term that is not 'tiles', 'coordinates' or

%!      executor(?Executor) is semidet.
%
%       Executor loop to use with controllers.

%       marked.
%

%!      overlay_precedence(?Case,?Precedence) is semidet.
%
%       Precedence terms when overlaying a map on top of another.
%
%       Case is an identifier for the clause of this option to be used
%       by predicates that call map overlay predicates.
%
%       Precedence is a list of key-value pairs T1 > T2 where T1 and T2
%       are tile symbols. Precedence may be empty and controls how tiles
%       are written from Overlaying on top of tiles in Underlying. If a
%       term T1 > T2 exists in Precedence, then a tile T1 can be written
%       over a tile T2. Otherwise, T1 cannot be written on top of T2.
%       This doesn't cause the overlaying operation to fail - only to
%       ignore the attempt to write T1 on top of T2 unless T1 > T2 is
%       there.

%!      output_actions(?Form) is semidet.
%
%       Form of actions output by executor/6.
%
%       Form is one of: [labels, tuples, executor_states]. Those are
%       interpreted as follows:
%
%       * labels: each element of the list of actions output by
%         executor/6 is an atomic action label found in a controller
%         tuple.
%       * tuples: each element of the actions list is a controller tuple
%         T(Q0,O,A,Q1)
%       * executor_states: each element of the actions list is a pair
%         S:T where S is an executor state, one of: [trv, rev, alt], and
%         T is a controller tuple T(Q0,O,A,Q1), as for 'tuple'.
%
%       Form 'executor_states' will fail unless the current executor is
%       a reversing executor, i.e. if the value of executor/1 is a
%       reference to a reversing executor.
%
%       @tbd More to the point, this option is currently only called by
%       reversing executors.

%!      sort_tuples(-Delta,+Tuple1,+Tuple2) is det.
%
%       Sorting helper for solver_controller/5.
%
%       Allows the set of tuples returned by solver_controller/5 to be
%       sorted in a custom order.
%
%       Two sorting predicates are provided below: one that sorts by the
%       standard order of terms, removing duplicates; and one that sorts
%       so that tuples with the same input and output states are placed
%       placed above others in the output. The latter can be used to
%       geneate controllers with a bias towards staying on their current
%       course, rather than nondeterministically switching directions.
%
%       Uncomment the sortin predicate you prefer, or define your own as
%       needed
%
%       The standard order of terms should be considered the default-ish
%       sorting method.

%!      table_executor(?Bool) is semidet.
%
%       Whether to table the current executor, or not.
%
%       @tbd Setting bool to true causes backtracking executors to
%       display very weird behaviour, e.g. they completely miss their
%       target and exit anyway. Needs some TLC.
