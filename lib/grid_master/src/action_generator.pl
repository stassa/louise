%
%       Rotate is a boolean, either 'true' or 'false', denoting whether

%       Recognise or genreate Coordinates in a map.
%
%       Coordinates is a term X/Y where any of X or Y can be a number,
%       or a variable. If either is a variable, it is bound to integers
%       starting at 0 and up to the corresponding term in Dimensions.
%
%       Dimensions is a term W-H, the Width and Height of the map.
%       Dimensions must be ground and W and H must both be numbers.

%
dec(X,X_):- X_ is X - 1.



%!      term_at_index(+Index,+Element,+Term,+Dimensions) is det.
%
%       Locate an Element in a Term indexed in row-major order.
%
%       Index is a pair of X/Y coordinates, corresponding to an index
%       into a 2-dimensional "array" stored as a Prolog term with
%       elements in row-major order, i.e. with reach row side-by-side
%       etc.
%
%       Element is the element at the specified Index.
%
%       Term is the Prolog term storing the "array".
%
%       Dimensions is a pair W-H of the width and height of the "array".

        ,arg(I,M,T).


%!      rotation(+Coordinates,+Dimensions,-Rotated) is det.
%
%       Transform between list-based and Cartesian coordinates.
%
%       Coordinates is a pair X/Y representing the x and y coordinates,
%       respectively, to be rotated.
%
%       Dimensions is a pair Max_x - Max_y listing the limits of the two
%       map dimensions.
%
%       Rotated is the pair X/Y transformed so that it is correct in a
%       Cartesian plan with the origin, 0/0, at the bottom-right corner.
%
%       This predicate is applied to the coordinates in a maze map given
%       as a list-of-lists, where each sub-list is a row of the map and
%       each element in a sub-list a tile in the map. The "natural"
%       (i.e. the easy) way to go through this list is by calling nth0/3
%       to find the n'th row, then nth0/3 again to find the n'th tile in
%       that row.
%
%       This "natural way" traverses the map from what is effectively
%       the top-left corner, meaning that the two calls to nth0/3 return
%       "0" as the index of the first element of the first sub-list. We
%       want to treat the maze as a Cartesian plane with the origin at
%       the bottom-left corner instead (because reasons; we may need to
%       calculate Euclidean distance, as a for instance) so this
%       predicate maps between the two representations by applying a
%       simple rotation to the input set of coordinates, to transform
%       them to proper Cartesian coordinates.
%
%       This predicate must be called by any predicate that inspects or
%       manipulates coordinates, e.g. the step_up/2 etc
%       primitive actions. Make sure to call it at the earliest point at
%       which a set of coordinates is encountered, to avoid code
%       duplication.
%
rotation(X/Y,_Mx-My,X/Yt):-
        Yt is (My - 1) - Y
        % Safe for arg/3.
